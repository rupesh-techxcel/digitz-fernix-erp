# Get all supplier other payment allocations which is still pending, to reconcile with the payment entry allocations to refresh the balances and pending of each documents. This calls in the stage 1 (as per the comment in the payment entry) of the loading of pending payments.
# Eg: Suppose the purchase invoice has total amount 1000 and 500 alocated in a payment entry. To create a new payment entry it requires to check the existing payment entires (other than the current payment entry) to get the actual balance of the invoice ie, 500 in the example. Here also only pending allocations are considering because if it is fully paid , in the initial call (with get_supplier_pending_documents) it only fetch pending documents and comparing only those documents
